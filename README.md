# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
This project also deployed on [Netlify](https://sahinmaral-memorycardgame.netlify.app/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### About Memory Card Game

<ul>
    <li>First of all , I would like to thank to <a href="https://github.com/Suleyman1406">Suleyman1406</a> to gave me inspiration about designing game on CSS and provided to start to learn Cloud Firebase.</li>
    <li>For deployment , I have used Netlify</li>
    <li>For state management , I have used Redux</li>
    <li>For saving and adding scores , I have used Cloud Firebase. I haven't used this platform and it was my first try.</li>
    <li>After entering site , we are asking you to enter name to save your score on scoreboard. Maybe you will pass someone else :)</li>
    <li>You are starting with 200 score. Each correct gives 50 points and each wrong takes 10 points.</li>
    <li>After matching all cards , you can see your score and scoreboard. You can play again if you want.</li>
    <li>During playing game , you can also reload game. </li>
</ul>
